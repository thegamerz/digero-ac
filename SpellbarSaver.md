Spellbar Saver is a multi-purpose utility for managing your spellbars. Uses include:
  * Have multiple spellbar setups for different occasions (such as PK and NPK) -- essentially extend AC's 7 bar limit.
  * Upgrade your spellbars when you graduate to a new level of spells.
  * Transfer your spellbars to another character (even if they can't cast the same level spells as your main).
  * Save and reload your spellbars in case they get wiped by the rare bug in AC.

## Notes ##
  * Check the box next to the school(s) of spells that you want to have automatically upgraded to the highest level you know, then select the range of levels you want Spellbar Saver to check when loading. It will only load the highest level you know _within that range_. If there's a spell on the bar that's lower than the minimum level, it won't be upgraded at all (e.g. Drain Health I won't be upgraded to Vitality Siphon unless the min life level is I, even if you know Vitality Siphon).

  * Select _Don't upgrade spells you know_ if you want to limit upgrading/downgrading to only the cases where you don't know a spell in a profile.

  * The _Show spellbars as they..._ option only affects which spell names are displayed in the lists on the left. It does not affect which spells will be put on the spellbar when you load a profile.

  * If you have the auto-save backups option enabled, Spellbar Saverwill automatically make a backup of your current spellbar setup when you load a bar. However, the next time you load a bar, it'll overwrite that backup with whatever you currently have on your bars. So you only get one chance to go back if you screw up =). Also, backup profiles aren't treated specially by the plugin, so when you load a backup it will save another backup of what you have before restoring, overwriting the currently loaded one.
