SSSort sorts the scrolls, salvage, or mana stones in your main pack or side packs. It has a number of specialized sorting criteria for scrolls, salvage, and mana stones. This is great if you want to make your scroll/salvage collection easier to browse on your tradebot, or just for your own sanity.

## Notes ##
  * You need to have a pack _selected_ (not just open) to sort the selected pack.

  * Sorting in all packs is the same as just sorting each pack one after the other; it doesn't treat all packs as one massive pack.

  * Sorting in reverse order is particularly useful for tradebots since the order gets reversed when you place the pack in the trade window.

  * The _Put sorted items at the bottom of the pack_ option will put all of the items at the bottom of your pack, rather than the top.

  * Type `/sort help` for a list of available chat commands.
