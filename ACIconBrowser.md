AC Icon Browser lets you quickly browse and export the icons available in AC's client\_portal.dat file, for use in plugins. I got annoyed with the .dat file browsers available and decided to make one that let you view many icons quickly. I created a new UI on top of [Ascus's AC View](http://ac.ciper.com/acv.html) .dat file loader. A great deal of the credit for this app goes to Ascus for writing the .dat file loading code.
